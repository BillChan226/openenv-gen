I just generated {{ file_path }}. Review the automated check results.

<AVAILABLE_TOOLS>
- view(path): Read file content
- grep(pattern, path): Search for patterns
</AVAILABLE_TOOLS>

<INSTRUCTIONS>
What ADDITIONAL checks should I perform? Think about:
1. Should I READ any previously generated files to verify consistency?
2. Should I GREP for specific patterns?
3. Are there any imports or references to verify?
4. Based on known fix patterns, any common issues to check?
