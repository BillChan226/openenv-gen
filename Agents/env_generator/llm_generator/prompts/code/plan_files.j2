<REQUIREMENTS>
{% for req in requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}
</REQUIREMENTS>

<ALLOWED_STRUCTURE>
Files MUST be created under: {{ target_directory }}

{% if structure %}
Recommended structure:
{{ structure }}

{% if existing_files %}
<EXISTING_FILES>
Already generated:
{% for file in existing_files %}
- {{ file }}
{% endfor %}
</EXISTING_FILES>
{% endif %}

{% if reference_files %}
<REFERENCE_FILES>
Suggested files (adapt as needed):
{% for file in reference_files %}
- {{ file.path }}: {{ file.purpose }}
{% endfor %}

<INSTRUCTIONS>
Plan which files to create. For each file:
1. Determine if it's needed based on requirements
2. Specify its exact path (within target_directory)
3. Define its purpose and dependencies
4. List what it needs to implement

Rules:
- Stay within target_directory
- Don't duplicate existing files
- Use consistent naming
- Consider dependencies between files
