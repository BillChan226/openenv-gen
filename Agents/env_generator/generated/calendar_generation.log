I will also look at tests (tests/test_models.py) and examples (examples/basic_usage.py) to infer the external API: how users are supposed to create actions, receive observations, and track state. Next, I will grep for references to OpenEnv, Action, Observation, and State to see if there are existing type hints, protocols, or interfaces that the new dataclasses must conform to. I will also search for existing dataclasses and any use of Pydantic or other modeling libraries to match style (e.g., immutability, validation). Once I understand the expectations, I will design three core dataclasses in openenv_adapter/models.py: Action, Observation, and State. These will likely include: (1) core payload fields (e.g., structured data for the environment), (2) metadata fields (timestamps, ids, step indices), and (3) optional helper methods (e.g., to_dict, from_dict, validation hooks) if consistent with the project. I will ensure type hints are precise and generic where appropriate (e.g., generics for observation and action payloads) so that the models are flexible but still well-typed. After drafting the code, I will mentally run a syntax check (and, in a real tool setting, run lint/syntax_check) and ensure import paths are minimal and stable. I will also consider whether these dataclasses should be frozen (immutable) to prevent accidental mutation of past states or observations, depending on patterns found elsewhere in the project.', 'considerations': ['Make sure the dataclasses align with any existing interfaces or expectations discovered via tests, examples, or other modules (e.g., method names like step, reset, or attribute names like action, observation, reward, done, info).', 'Ensure consistent typing and style with the rest of the codebase: use the same dataclass configuration (frozen, slots, repr) and type hint conventions (e.g., Optional, Mapping vs Dict, Sequence vs List).', 'Be careful about circular imports: models.py should only import from standard library and typing, and not from heavier modules that might also depend on models.', 'Consider whether these models need to be serializable (e.g., to JSON or dict). If so, design fields and helper methods to support straightforward serialization without custom encoders where possible.', 'Think about immutability: State and Observation are often better as immutable snapshots, whereas Action might be constructed and mutated before being sent.

Next, I will skim openenv_adapter/models.py to check for any dependencies (like databases, external services, or local file paths) that may require additional system packages or volumes in the Docker image.

After that, using grep results, I will confirm the server start command, the port it listens on, and any optional extras like reload flags that should not be used in production. With all that context, I will design a Dockerfile that: uses an appropriate Python base image; sets a working directory; copies requirements and installs them; copies the application code; sets suitable environment variables (like PYTHONUNBUFFERED, PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE); exposes the correct port; and defines a CMD/ENTRYPOINT that starts the server.
