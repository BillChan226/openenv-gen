As the User Agent (PM/QA), evaluate this plan:
1. Does it cover all requirements for the current task?
2. Is the structure reasonable and complete?
3. Are there any missing files or components?
4. Is the order of implementation logical?

Respond with JSON:
{
  "approved": true/false,
  "feedback": "Your overall feedback",
  "suggestions": ["suggestion 1"],
  "missing_items": ["any items that should be added to the plan"],
  "concerns": ["any concerns about the approach"]
}

Be constructive. If the plan is mostly good, approve it with minor suggestions.
Only reject if there are significant issues.
