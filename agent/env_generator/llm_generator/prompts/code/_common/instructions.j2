<INSTRUCTIONS>
**RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:**

1. **Read Context** (Optional but recommended)
   - Use read_memory_bank() to understand project context and previous decisions

2. **Plan Your Work** - Use plan() to create a checklist of what you'll do:
   ```
   plan(action="create", items=[
     "Create main entry file",
     "Create component X",
     "Create service Y",
     ...
   ])
   ```
   IMPORTANT: You CANNOT call finish() until ALL plan items are marked complete!

3. **Check Current State** - Use project_structure() to see what already exists

4. **Execute Your Plan** - For each plan item:
   - Use think() to reason about implementation details
   - Create the file(s)
   - Run lint ONCE
   - Mark item complete: plan(action="complete", item_text="...")

5. **Complete** - Call finish() when ALL plan items are done

**You decide what files to create based on the requirements!**
