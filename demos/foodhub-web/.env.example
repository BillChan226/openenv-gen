# Docker Compose project name.
#
# In some CI/runner environments, Docker Compose can reuse stale project/container
# state across runs if the same project name is used, leading to errors like:
#   Error: No such container: <id>
#
# Recommendation:
# - Local dev: you can keep a stable name.
# - CI: set a unique name per run, e.g. foodhub_${GITHUB_RUN_ID}.
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=foodhub
